Electron Web App allows you to run a website, web app, or web page on your
Desktop as a stand-alone application.

This is useful for when you need to access a specific website daily, for example
for tracking work you've completed. Using this tool, you can run it separately
from your web browser and have it easily accessible via an icon on your desktop.

To get it running, you will need to 
[install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), 
[install the Electron framework using npm](https://github.com/electron/electron#downloads), 
and then run the app.

To configure the app, you can edit the `config.json` file to set the app's title
and URL, and add an icon of your choice to the resources folder. This icon will
show up as the icon when the program is running.

Details on using it are on its 
[github page](https://github.com/andrewrproper/electron-web-app).
