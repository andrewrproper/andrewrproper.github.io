This is another experiment with texture by itself as an art piece. 
Somehow pure textures speak to me and give an impression that more 
realistic artwork does not achieve for me. This one is grayscale 
and vertically and horizontally symmetrical, giving even more 
emphasis to the texture itself. It has the appearance of being 
slightly raised, which almost gives it a relief or sculpture feeling.
