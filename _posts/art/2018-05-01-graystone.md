Sometimes, texture in art art piece just seems to stand alone 
and be sufficient on its own. Sometimes, I enjoy creating a 
piece that is primarily, or only, texture. This is one of 
those pieces. It may almost seem to have no subject, but of 
course the feel of texture itself is the subject and meaning here.
