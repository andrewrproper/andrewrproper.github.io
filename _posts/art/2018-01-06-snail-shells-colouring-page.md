Recently, I created this colouring page using
[Krita](https://krita.org/) 
and a 
[Huion](https://www.huiontablet.com/) 
drawing tablet. It was a very enjoyable
experience, to learn more about Krita and
the tables, as this is the first artwork 
with detail that I've made with either of them.

## Download and Print

I've decided to offer the 
[source files and printable PDF as a free download](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u9xfoq5iz9wlhmn/AADC26fLWiDdEjuGE_eBGnbza?dl=0)
under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license (details below).

The purpose of this colouring page is for printing, and 
then colouring by hand. You can print the pdf file to get 
the colouring page, and then colour with markers, 
pencil crayons, etc.

### File Formats

`.kra` - Krita image file - This is the original source file, 
created with the open-source drawing program, Krita. 
The file was created at 300 dpi resolution, so that it 
can be printed at fairly good quality.

`.png` - PNG file - From Krita the file was exported to 
PNG, without loss of quality but without the layers 
needed for editing in Krita.

`.odt` - OpenDocument text - The PNG image was imported 
into this file for basic layout, in order to set the 
margins of the page, for printing. This was done 
using LibreOffice.

`.pdf` - PDF file - The OpenDocument text file was 
exported to PDF for easier viewing and printing. 
This file also contains XMP data about the license.
