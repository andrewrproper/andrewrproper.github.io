I took a *Mixed Media on Paper* class at the 
Dundas Valley School of Art. 
I enjoyed experimenting with the India Ink and 
watercolours together. 
My best results were when I was drawing or painting something 
structural, like pipes on a wall or these chairs. 
This piece was done with India Ink and watercolours on paper.
