A couple of days ago, the girls went to climb 
the front tree, and discovered this cicada on 
the side of the tree. It was perched on the 
bark, near the bottom branches, not moving. 
Even when they climbed right past it, it did 
not move. This gave me a chance to get a 
close-up photo. I really enjoy taking 
photos of nature.
