I created this artwork using the 
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) 
sometime around 2002. Since then, I have created a number of variations on 
it, and it has remained one of my favourites, if not my most favourite 
artwork that I’ve created. It has a simple beauty and appeal that I enjoy greatly.
